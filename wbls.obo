Cell  fates,  including  cell divisions and expression of cell fate markers, are equivalent between L3 and PDL3 stages (Liu and Ambros, 1991; Euling  and  Ambros,  1996;  Braendle  and  Félix,  2008;  Karp  and  Greenwald,  2013).  However,  no  molt  occurs between dauer and PDL3. Thus, dauer alae are still visible on the cuticle, although more difficult to see because they become stretched as the larva loses radial constriction and begins to grow (Cassada and Russell, 1975; Riddle et al.,1997).\"" xsd:string {xref="PMID:27417559"}

Hooks are the first fully-differentiated structures formed at the apical region of the nascent scolex. A cone can later be seen at the center of the hooks, the body is expanded and a structured neck is evident between the scolex and the body. During protoscolex development this parasitic form remains attached to the germinative layer through a stalk. When fully differentiated, the stalk is cut off and the infective protoscolex is now free in the hydatid fluid. This stage ends when the protoscolex attaches, via the scolex, to the host intestinal tissue and begins to develop into a adult." [PMID:12462989, WB:jl]

PDL4 larvae are morphologically indistinguishable from L4 larvae, at least at the gross level. Similarly, PDadults appear identical to adults that developed continuously. However, subtle differences do exist. For example,some changes in muscle arm and neuronal cell structure persist in post-dauer stages (Dixon et al., 2008; Schroeder et al., 2013). Interestingly, this apparent similarity between post-dauer and continuously developed animals belies a number of changes at the level of expression of protein coding and small RNA coding genes, as well as changes in chromatin structure (Hall et al., 2010; Karp et al., 2011; Hall et al., 2013).\"" xsd:string {xref="PMID:27417559"}

property_value: IAO:0000116 "An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string
